              <h3>How is AAC2013 different from any other DevFest?</h3>
              <ol>
              <li><p><b>Women focus</b></p>
              <p>
              While both events are similar, AAC2013 has an emphasis on female inclusion. 
              What form this element takes will depend on local interest and needs, 
              but here are some things to consider during the planning process:
			 </p>
             <p><b>Women speakers</b><br/>
             Make a concerted effort to recruit good women speakers. Include them in the planning process 
             and bring in their communities.
			 </p>
			 <p><b>Women organizers</b><br/>
              If no one on the regular organizing committee is a woman, this is a great opportunity 
              to seek out potential women organizers to champion this event and diversity in your local group.
              </p>

             <p><b>Partnerships with local women developer organizations.</b><br/>
             You'll likely need to partner up with an organization primarily focused on women in technology to:
             </p>
             
             <ul>
             <li>Get feedback on what women devs would like to see at the event</li>
             <li>Promote the event</li>
             <li>Find women speakers/panelists</li>
			 </ul>
			 
             <p>All of this is, of course, a 2-way street, so organizers should look for ways to 
             have an ongoing relationship in the future (e.g. co-promoting events, sharing speakers, etc.).
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>Some examples of groups in the Bay Area are Girl Develop It, 
			 Women Who Code, Women 2.0. Here is a list of organizations dedicated to women in tech. 
			 You can also search sites like meetup.com to find local groups. Many universities also have 
			 Women in Engineering clubs on campus that you may try to reach out to for potential attendees.
			 </p>

              </li>
              
              <li><p><b>Duration</b></p>
              <p>
              DevFests generally span anywhere from 6-hours to 2-days. In order to make AAC2013 as 
              accessible as possible, there is <b>no minimum duration requirement</b> for the event. 
              Instead, we encourage all relevant events, big or small, to participate in this initiative. 
              This means a AAC2013 event may include anything from a full-on 2-day speaker series + hackathon 
              event, to a 2-hr group code lab. It's up to you.</p>

              <p>Hold your event anytime between now and March 10, 2013 to be included in AAC2013 season.</p>              
              </li>
              
              <li><p><b>Content</b></p>
              <p>Like a regular DevFest, the content should still have an emphasis on Google developer 
              platforms/products -- whether that be a free form hackathon, code lab, or technical lecture. 
              You should also get feedback from women in your community to see if there is demand for 
              sessions like Q&A/panel sessions with prominent women tech leaders in the local community.
              </p>

             <p>Some communities report that having a structured, beginner-friendly atmosphere 
             tends to promote more equal gender.</p>
             </li>
             
              </ol>             
            
              <h3>Are AAC2013 events women-only?</h3>
              <p>AAC2013 is not intended to be women-only, but is instead an opportunity for 
              developer communities to be more mindful of female inclusion. 
              However, if an exclusive event is determined to be the most culturally 
              appropriate to the hosting community, this is certainly acceptable.</p>
            
              <h3>Why AAC2013?</h3>
              <p>Google believes diversity and inclusion is important for thriving, 
              vibrant communities. Focusing on women-inclusion is the first step in a 
              larger effort to diversify the global Google developer community. The 
              GDG community has shown great interest in this initiative, so we are 
              offering them the reigns to push it forward with a women-focused DevFest.</p>
              
              <p>
              Google will be hosting GDG Silicon Valley AAC2013 event in Mountain View, 
              CA on March 1-2, 2013. More details on agenda and live streaming access to come.</p>
